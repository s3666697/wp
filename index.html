          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I've done a few other programming units and completed a Diploma of Multimedia many years ago. I've also done a few personal website projects over the years and I've started to dip my toes into some web projects at my work.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I enjoy both for different reasons. The problem solving of programming can be fun, though it can also be incredibly frustrating, but rewarding when you finally find the missing piece you've spent 4 hours looking for. The designer side is great for being more creative and having more freedom over what you're doing, not being constrained to the rules of programming is a nice change.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I work full time so online study was the most practical option for me, after a bit of research I discovered Open Universities and am currently working towards a Bachelor of IT.</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I'm currently employed in the software industry so hoping to upskill myself to further my employment opportunities and to help out with my current job.</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>I'm a pretty independent kind of worker, if I'm told what needs to be done I'll happily figure out the rest. If there's paired work I'd like that person to be similar, as I'm working full time I don't have heaps of time to chat during the week so someone who's comfortable jut helping make decisions at the start on who will do what parts, then getting the work done.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I'm on reddit an unhealthy amount, besides that a few gaming blogs like Polygon, Kotaku, and just your typical news websites.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I love playing video games, reading comic books, watching TV shows / movies - anything geeky really! I go through stages of drawing too which I'm a bit overdue for.</div>
